The iris dataset from the sklearn library has been used to build a classifier that distinguishes between 3 different types :
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris versicolor
3. Iris verginica
This dataset has 50 flowers of each variety

The classification is done using 4 features, namely:
a. Sepal length of the flower
b. Sepal width of the flower
c. Petal length of the flower
d. Petal width of the flower

Support Vector classifier model is used for this project. The model thus created has also been deployed as a web App using StreamLit
